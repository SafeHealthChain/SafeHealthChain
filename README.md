# SafeHealthChain
## Problem we want to solve

Our team considers it essential to update the medical records management system to facilitate user access to their own data. Additionally, we value the implementation of vaccination credentials, which are crucial in preventing falsification and simplifying the tracking of vaccination history without the need for paper records or physical booklets. Furthermore, we appreciate the innovation represented by prescription credentials, given their ability to prevent forgery and provide detailed information about the responsible physician when necessary. Lastly, optimizing the process of changing medical centers is essential to improving the patient experience, allowing users to authorize the new center to access their data, which would remain under their direct control. 

###The key improvements that this solution offers are:

1. Improvement of user access to their own health data: By enabling users to manage and control their own medical records, the project facilitates the access and management of personal health information in a secure and efficient manner.
2. Secure authentication and credential verification: By implementing technologies such as Polygon ID and Trinsic ID, the project ensures secure user authentication and health credential verification, helping to prevent data forgery and enhancing security in accessing medical services.
3. Simplification of the process for changing medical centers: By allowing users to retain full control of their medical history, the project streamlines the process of switching healthcare providers, enabling users to authorize the access of their information to new providers.
4. Security and privacy of health data: The use of blockchain technologies and other security measures ensures the integrity of medical data, preventing information tampering, and safeguarding user privacy.

###Key points of the project:

- Purpose/Challenge: Our project aims to improve the accessibility and security of health data management, addressing the complexities in data sharing and ensuring a user-centric approach to healthcare information.
- Users/Stakeholders: The key stakeholders involved in our project include patients, healthcare providers, medical institutions, pharmacies, and insurance entities, all of whom are integral to the seamless functioning of the healthcare ecosystem.
- Expectations/Preferences: We expect user-friendly solutions that prioritize data security and efficiency, while acknowledging potential challenges such as technical intricacies in implementation and the necessity for a smooth transition process within healthcare institutions.
- Measurement of Success: Success will be evaluated based on enhanced data transfer efficiency, positive user experiences, minimized errors in data management, and the long-term impact on overall healthcare quality and patient satisfaction.
